<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>No liability for taking down generally.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Subject to paragraph (2), a data service provider shall not be liable to any person for any claim based on the service provider’s good faith disabling of access to, or removal of, material or activity claimed to be infringing or based on facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent, regardless of whether the material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Exception.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to material residing at the direction of a subscriber of the data service provider on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider that is removed, or to which access is disabled by the service provider, pursuant to a notice provided under subsection (c)(1)(C), unless the service provider—
takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled access to the material;
upon receipt of a counter notification described in paragraph (3), promptly provides the person who provided the notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) with a copy of the counter notification, and informs that person that it will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days; and
replaces the removed material and ceases disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless its designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the service provider’s system or network.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Contents of counter notification.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">To be effective under this subsection, a counter notification must be a written communication provided to the service provider’s designated agent that includes substantially the following:
A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber.
Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
The subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Limitation on other liability.</bold></h3> – <p style="margin-top: 15px;">A data service provider’s compliance with paragraph (2) shall not subject the service provider to liability for copyright infringement with respect to the material identified in the notice provided under subsection (c)(1)(C).</p>

<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Subpoena to Identify Infringer</bold></h3>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Request.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">A copyright owner or a person authorized to act on the owner’s behalf may request the clerk of any United States district court to issue a subpoena to a service provider for identification of an alleged infringer in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Contents of request.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The request may be made by filing with the clerk—
a copy of a notification described in subsection (c)(3)(A);
a proposed subpoena; and
a sworn declaration to the effect that the purpose for which the subpoena is sought is to obtain the identity of an alleged infringer and that such information will only be used for the purpose of protecting rights under this title.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Contents of subpoena.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The subpoena shall authorize and order the service provider receiving the notification and the subpoena to expeditiously disclose to the copyright owner or person authorized by the copyright owner information sufficient to identify the alleged infringer of the material described in the notification to the extent such information is available to the service provider.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Basis for granting subpoena.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">If the notification filed satisfies the provisions of subsection (c)(3)(A), the proposed subpoena is in proper form, and the accompanying declaration is properly executed, the clerk shall expeditiously issue and sign the proposed subpoena and return it to the requester for delivery to the service provider.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Actions of service provider receiving subpoena.—</bold></h3><p style="margin-top: 15px;"> Upon receipt of the issued subpoena, either accompanying or subsequent to the receipt of a notification described in subsection (c)(3)(A), the service provider shall expeditiously disclose to the copyright owner or person authorized by the copyright owner the information required by the subpoena, notwithstanding any other provision of law and regardless of whether the service provider responds to the notification.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Rules applicable to subpoena.—</bold></h3><p style="margin-top: 15px;"> Unless otherwise provided by this section or by applicable rules of the court, the procedure for issuance and delivery of the subpoena, and the remedies for noncompliance with the subpoena, shall be governed to the greatest extent practicable by those provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing the issuance, service, and enforcement of a subpoena duces tecum.</p>

<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Conditions for Eligibility.—</bold></h3>

<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Accommodation of technology.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The limitations on liability established by this section shall apply to a service provider only if the service provider—
has adopted and reasonably implemented, and informs subscribers and account holders of the data service provider’s system or network of, a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account holders of the service provider’s system or network who are repeat infringers; and
accommodates and does not interfere with standard technical measures.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Definition.— </bold></h3><p style="margin-top: 15px;">As used in this subsection, the term “standard technical measures” means technical measures that are used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works and—
have been developed pursuant to a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers in an open, fair, voluntary, multi-industry standards process;
are available to any person on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms; and
do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Injunctions.—</bold></h3><p style="margin-top: 15px;">The following rules shall apply in the case of any application for an injunction under section 502 against a service provider that is not subject to monetary remedies under this section:</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Scope of relief.—</bold></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 15px;">With respect to conduct other than that which qualifies for the limitation on remedies set forth in subsection (a), the court may grant injunctive relief with respect to a service provider only in one or more of the following forms:
An order restraining the service provider from providing access to infringing material or activity residing at a particular online site on the provider’s system or network.
An order restraining the service provider from providing access to a subscriber or account holder of the service provider’s system or network who is engaging in infringing activity and is identified in the order, by terminating the accounts of the subscriber or account holder that are specified in the order.
Such other injunctive relief as the court may consider necessary to prevent or restrain infringement of copyrighted material specified in the order of the court at a particular online location, if such relief is the least burdensome to the service provider among the forms of relief comparably effective for that purpose.
If the service provider qualifies for the limitation on remedies described in subsection (a), the court may only grant injunctive relief in one or both of the following forms:
An order restraining the service provider from providing access to a subscriber or account holder of the service provider’s system or network who is using the provider’s service to engage in infringing activity and is identified in the order, by terminating the accounts of the subscriber or account holder that are specified in the order.
An order restraining the service provider from providing access, by taking reasonable steps specified in the order to block access, to a specific, identified, online location outside the United States.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Considerations.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The court, in considering the relevant criteria for injunctive relief under applicable law, shall consider—
whether such an injunction, either alone or in combination with other such injunctions issued against the same service provider under this subsection, would significantly burden either the provider or the operation of the provider’s system or network;
the magnitude of the harm likely to be suffered by the copyright owner in the digital network environment if steps are not taken to prevent or restrain the infringement;
whether implementation of such an injunction would be technically feasible and effective, and would not interfere with access to non-infringing material at other online locations; and
whether other less burdensome and comparably effective means of preventing or restraining access to the infringing material are available.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Notice and ex parte orders.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Injunctive relief under this subsection shall be available only after notice to the service provider and an opportunity for the service provider to appear are provided, except for orders ensuring the preservation of evidence or other orders having no material adverse effect on the operation of the service provider’s communications network.</p>

<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Definitions.—</bold></h3>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Data Service provider.—</bold></h3>
<p style="margin-top: 15px;">As used in subsection (a), the term “service provider” means an entity offering the transmission of personal data, marketing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user’s choosing, without modification to the content of the material as sent or received.
As used in this section, other than subsection (a), the term “service provider” means a provider of online services or network access, or the operator of facilities therefore, and includes an entity described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Monetary relief.—</bold></h3> <p style="margin-top: 15px;">As used in this section, the term “monetary relief” means damages, costs, attorneys’ fees, and any other form of monetary payment.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:5px;"><bold>Protection of Privacy.— </bold></h3><p style="margin-top: 15px;">Nothing in this section shall be construed to condition the applicability of subsections (a) through (d) on—
a service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with a standard technical measure complying with the provisions of subsection (i); or
a service provider gaining access to, removing, or disabling access to material in cases in which such conduct is prohibited by law.</p>
